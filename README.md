## API Keys

For this demo to work, please create a Google Map API Key (you will need to enable billing) and ensure that the two services below are enabled... otherwise it won't work!
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API
- Geocoding API
 This API key must be in a .env.local file `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`.
Furthermore you will also need to get an API key from  [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Rbrand&utm_content=394051365970&utm_term=cloudinary%20api&gclid=CjwKCAjwnK36BRBVEiwAsMT8WAz9WKB1C4n0cmtnGLSslSEoWPs446ZHCnFywmUBc1_QPjvhjmoduBoCa1IQAvD_BwE)
Please check the .env.local.example file to see what the .env file will look like
